Feature: Camel K can correctly filter messages from broker

  Background:
    Given create Knative broker default
    Given Knative broker default is running
    Given Disable auto removal of Camel K resources
    Given Disable auto removal of Kubernetes resources
    Given Camel K resource polling configuration
      | maxAttempts          | 60   |
      | delayBetweenAttempts | 3000 |

  Scenario: Integration sends messages to the broker
    Given create Camel K integration sender.groovy
    """
    from('timer:tick?period=1000')
      .setBody().constant('event-1')

    from('timer:tick?period=1000')
      .setBody().constant('event-all')
      .to('knative:event')
    """
    Then Camel K integration sender should be running


  Scenario: Integration receives the correct messages from the broker
    Given create Camel K integration receiver.groovy
