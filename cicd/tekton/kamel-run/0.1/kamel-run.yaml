    Run a Camel Integration

    Kamel-run task creates a Camel K Integration which will be taken and operated by Camel K operator. You can either use this task to
    run a build from source or build the application in previous tasks and use this last task to deploy and let Camel K operates it.

      description: The location of Camel K CLI image.
      default: docker.io/apache/camel-k:2.0.0
    - name: filename
      description: the Integration source we want to run
    - name: namespace
      description: the namespace where to run the integration
      default: ""
