Apache Camel K (a.k.a. Kamel) is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Camel K allows to run integrations directly on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes.

If you need help on how to create a local development environment based on *Minishift* or *Minikube*, you can follow the link:/docs/cluster-setup.adoc[local cluster setup guide].

[[installation]]
=== Installation

To start using Camel K you need the **"kamel"** binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
Look into the https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases[release page] for latest version of the `kamel` tool.

If you want to contribute, you can also **build it from source!** Refer to the link:/docs/developers.adoc[developer's guide]
for information on how to do it.

Once you have the "kamel" binary, log into your cluster using the standard "oc" (OpenShift) or "kubectl" (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:

```
kamel install
```

This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace.

IMPORTANT: Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately this
operation can be done *once per cluster*. So, if the `kamel install` operation fails, you'll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.
For Minishift, this means executing `oc login -u system:admin` then `kamel install --cluster-setup` only for first-time installation.

=== Running a Integration

After the initial setup, you can run a Camel integration on the cluster by executing:

```
kamel run runtime/examples/Sample.java
```

A "Sample.java" file is included in the link:/runtime/examples[/runtime/examples] folder of this repository. You can change the content of the file and execute the command again to see the changes.

==== Configure Integration properties

Properties associated to an integration can be configured either using a ConfigMap/Secret or by setting using the "--property" flag, i.e.

```
kamel run --property my.message=test runtime/examples/props.js
```

==== Configure Integration Logging

camel-k runtime uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the `logging.level` prefix:

```
logging.level.org.apache.camel = DEBUG
```

==== Configure Integration Components

camel-k component can be configured programmatically inside an integration or using properties with the following syntax.

```
camel.component.${scheme}.${property} = ${value}
```

As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:

```
camel.component.seda.queueSize = 10
```

=== Running Integrations in "Dev" Mode for Fast Feedback

If you want to iterate quickly on a integration to have fast feedback on the code you're writing, you can use run it in **"dev" mode**:

```
kamel run runtime/examples/Sample.java --dev
```

The `--dev` flag deploys immediately the integration and shows the integration logs in the console. You can then change the code and see
the **changes automatically applied (instantly)** to the remote integration pod.

The console follows automatically all redeploys of the integration.

Here's an example of the output:

```
[nferraro@localhost camel-k]$ kamel run runtime/examples/Sample.java --dev
integration "sample" created
integration "sample" in phase Building
integration "sample" in phase Deploying
integration "sample" in phase Running

```

=== Dependencies and Component Resolution

Camel components used in a integration are automatically resolved. For example, take the following integration:

```
from("imap://admin@myserver.com")
  .to("seda:output")
```

Since the integration is using the **"imap:" prefix**, Camel K is able to **automatically add the "camel-mail" component** to the list of required dependencies.
This will be transparent to the user, that will just see the integration running.

Automatic resolution is also a nice feature in `--dev` mode, because you are allowed to add all components you need without exiting the dev loop.

You can also use the `-d` flag to pass additional explicit dependencies to the Camel client tool:

```
kamel run -d mvn:com.google.guava:guava:26.0-jre -d camel-mina2 Integration.java
```

=== Not Just Java

Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations:

.Languages
[options="header"]
|=======================
| Language			| Description
| Java				| Both integrations in source `.java` files or compiled `.class` file can be run.
| XML				| Integrations written in plain XML DSL are supported (Spring XML or Blueprint not supported).
| Groovy			| Groovy `.groovy` files are supported (experimental).
| JavaScript        | JavaScript `.js` files are supported (experimental).
| Kotlin			| Kotlin Script `.kts` files are supported (experimental).
|=======================

More information about supported languages is provided in the link:docs/languages.adoc[languages guide].

Integrations written in different languages are provided in the link:/runtime/examples[examples] directory.

An example of integration written in JavaScript is the link:/runtime/examples/dns.js[/runtime/examples/dns.js] integration.
Here's the content:

```
// Lookup every second the 'www.google.com' domain name and log the output
from('timer:dns?period=1s')
    .routeId('dns')
    .setHeader('dns.domain')
        .constant('www.google.com')
    .to('dns:ip')
    .to('log:dns');
```

To run it, you need just to execute:

```
kamel run runtime/examples/dns.js
```

=== Traits

The details of how the integration is mapped into Kubernetes resources can be *customized using traits*.
More information is provided in the link:docs/traits.adoc[traits section].

=== Monitoring the Status

Camel K integrations follow a lifecycle composed of several steps before getting into the `Running` state.
You can check the status of all integrations by executing the following command:

```
kamel get
```
