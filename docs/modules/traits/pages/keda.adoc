= Keda Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The KEDA trait can be used for automatic integration with KEDA autoscalers.
The trait can be either manually configured using the `triggers` option or automatically configured
via markers in the Kamelets.

For information on how to use KEDA enabled Kamelets with the KEDA trait, refer to
xref:ROOT:kamelets/kamelets-user.adoc#kamelet-keda-user[the KEDA section in the Kamelets user guide].
If you want to create Kamelets that contain KEDA metadata, refer to
xref:ROOT:kamelets/kamelets-dev.adoc#kamelet-keda-dev[the KEDA section in the Kamelets development guide].

The KEDA trait is disabled by default.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.

== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait keda.[key]=[value] --trait keda.[key2]=[value2] integration.groovy
----
The following configuration options are available:

|Property | Type | Description

| keda.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

| keda.auto
| bool
| Enables automatic configuration of the trait. Allows the trait to infer KEDA triggers from the Kamelets.

| keda.hack-controller-replicas
| bool
| Set the spec->replicas field on the top level controller to an explicit value if missing, to allow KEDA to recognize it as a scalable resource.

| keda.polling-interval
| int32
| Interval (seconds) to check each trigger on.

| keda.cooldown-period
| int32
| The wait period between the last active trigger reported and scaling the resource back to 0.

| keda.idle-replica-count
| int32
| Enabling this property allows KEDA to scale the resource down to the specified number of replicas.

| keda.min-replica-count
| int32
| Minimum number of replicas.

| keda.max-replica-count
| int32
| Maximum number of replicas.

| keda.triggers
| []github.com/apache/camel-k/addons/keda.kedaTrigger
| Definition of triggers according to the KEDA format. Each trigger must contain `type` field corresponding
to the name of a KEDA autoscaler and a key/value map named `metadata` containing specific trigger options.
An optional `authentication-secret` can be declared per trigger and the operator will link each entry of
the secret to a KEDA authentication parameter.
