= Platform Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The platform trait is a base trait that is used to assign an integration platform to an integration.

In case the platform is missing, the trait is allowed to create a default platform.
This feature is especially useful in contexts where there's no need to provide a custom configuration for the platform
(e.g. on OpenShift the default settings work, since there's an embedded container image registry).


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.

WARNING: The platform trait is a *platform trait*: disabling it may compromise the platform functionality.
