// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The Container trait can be used to configure properties of the container where the integration will run.

It also provides configuration for Services associated to the container.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.

WARNING: The container trait is a *platform trait*: disabling it may compromise the platform functionality.

== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait container.[key]=[value] --trait container.[key2]=[value2] integration.groovy
----
The following configuration options are available:
