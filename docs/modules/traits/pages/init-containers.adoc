== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait init-containers.[key]=[value] --trait init-containers.[key2]=[value2] integration.yaml
----
The following configuration options are available:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| init-containers.enabled
| bool
| Deprecated: no longer in use.

| init-containers.auto
| bool
| To automatically enable the trait

| init-containers.init-tasks
| []string
| A list of init tasks to be executed with format `<name>;<container-image>;<container-command>`.

| init-containers.sidecar-tasks
| []string
| A list of sidecar tasks to be executed with format `<name>;<container-image>;<container-command>`.

== An example init container

Create an Integration which read some value initialized by an init container. The following route takes care to read a file which is expected to be initialized by another process.

[source,yaml]
.route.yaml
----
- route:
    from:
      # Read a file that should have been initialized
      # by the initContainer
      uri: file:/tmp
      parameters:
        fileName: init
      steps:
        - log:
            message: "${body}"
----

The route is agnostic how this file is generated.

When creating the Integration, then, it should include an init container taking care to initialize such file, for example:

[source,console]
----
kamel run route.yaml -t mount.empty-dirs=common:/tmp -t init-containers.tasks="init;alpine;/bin/sh -c \"echo hello >> /tmp/init\""
----

As the file is shared between the containers you will need to provide a shared volume (an `EmtpyDir` in this case).
