= Deployer Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The deployer trait is responsible for deploying the resources owned by the integration, and can be used
to explicitly select the underlying controller that will manage the integration pods.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.

WARNING: The deployer trait is a *platform trait*: disabling it may compromise the platform functionality.

== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait deployer.[key]=[value] --trait deployer.[key2]=[value2] integration.groovy
----
The following configuration options are available:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| deployer.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

| deployer.kind
| string
| Allows to explicitly select the desired deployment kind between `deployment`, `cron-job` or `knative-service` when creating the resources for running the integration.

| deployer.use-ssa
| bool
| Use server-side apply to update the owned resources (default `true`).
Note that it automatically falls back to client-side patching, if SSA is not available, e.g., on old Kubernetes clusters.
