= Jvm Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The JVM trait is used to configure the JVM that runs the Integration. This trait can be configured only for Integration and related IntegrationKits
(bound to a container image) built by Camel K operator. If the system detects the usage of a different container image (ie, built externally), then, the
trait is disabled by the platform.

NOTE: the platform will skip the trait configuration for those container image matching `camel-k-kit-` name.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.
