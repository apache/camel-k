= Service Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The Service trait exposes the integration with a Service resource so that it can be accessed by other applications
(or integrations) in the same namespace.

It's enabled by default if the integration depends on a Camel component that can expose a HTTP endpoint.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.
