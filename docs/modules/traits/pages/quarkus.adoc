= Quarkus Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The Quarkus trait configures the Quarkus runtime.

It's enabled by default.

NOTE: A native based compilation will be forced to use a `pod` build strategy.
Compiling to a native executable, i.e. when using `build-mode=native`, requires at least
4GiB of memory, so the Pod running the native build, must have enough memory available.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.

NOTE: The quarkus trait is a *platform trait* and cannot be disabled by the user.

== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait quarkus.[key]=[value] --trait quarkus.[key2]=[value2] integration.groovy
----
The following configuration options are available:

|Property | Type | Description

| quarkus.enabled
| bool
| Deprecated: no longer in use.

| quarkus.package-type
| []github.com/apache/camel-k/v2/pkg/apis/camel/v1/trait.QuarkusPackageType
| The Quarkus package types, `fast-jar` or `native` (default `fast-jar`).
In case both `fast-jar` and `native` are specified, two `IntegrationKit` resources are created,
with the native kit having precedence over the `fast-jar` one once ready.
The order influences the resolution of the current kit for the integration.
The kit corresponding to the first package type will be assigned to the
integration in case no existing kit that matches the integration exists.
Deprecated: use `build-mode` instead.

| quarkus.build-mode
| []github.com/apache/camel-k/v2/pkg/apis/camel/v1/trait.QuarkusMode
| The Quarkus mode to run: either `jvm` or `native` (default `jvm`).
In case both `jvm` and `native` are specified, two `IntegrationKit` resources are created,
with the `native` kit having precedence over the `jvm` one once ready.

| quarkus.native-base-image
| string
| The base image to use when running a native build (default `quay.io/quarkus/quarkus-micro-image:2.0`)

| quarkus.native-builder-image
| string
| The image containing the tooling required for a native build (by default it will use the one provided in the runtime catalog)
