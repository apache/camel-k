== Configuration

Trait properties can be specified when running any integration with the CLI:
[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --trait quarkus.[key]=[value] --trait quarkus.[key2]=[value2] integration.groovy
----
The following configuration options are available:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| quarkus.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

| quarkus.package-type
| []./pkg/trait.quarkusPackageType
| The Quarkus package types, either `fast-jar` or `native` (default `fast-jar`).
In case both `fast-jar` and `native` are specified, two IntegrationKits are created,
with the `native` kit having precedence over the `fast-jar' one once ready.
The order influences the resolution of the current IntegrationKit for the Integration.
The IntegrationKit corresponding to the first package type will be assigned to the
Integration in case no existing IntegrationKit that matches the Integration exists.
