= Resume Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The Resume trait can be used to manage and configure resume strategies.

This feature is meant to allow quick resume of processing by Camel K instances after they have been restarted. This
is an experimental implementation based on the support available on Camel Core resume strategies.

The Resume trait is disabled by default.

The main different from the implementation on Core is that it's not necessary to bind the strategies to the
registry. This step will be done automatically by Camel K, after resolving the options passed to the trait.

A sample execution of this trait, using the Kafka backend (the only one supported at the moment), would require
the following trait options:
-t resume.enabled=true -t resume.resume-path=camel-file-sets -t resume.resume-server="address-of-your-kafka:9092"


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.
