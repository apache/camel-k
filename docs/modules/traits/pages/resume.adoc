The Resume trait can be used to manage and configure resume strategies.

This feature is meant to allow quick resume of processing by Camel K instances after they have been restarted.

WARNING: this is an experimental implementation based on the support available on link:/components/next/eips/resume-strategies.html[Camel Core resume strategies].

The Resume trait is disabled by default.

WARNING: The trait is **deprecated** and will removed in future release versions: configure directly the Camel properties as required by the component instead.

The main different from the implementation on Core is that it's not necessary to bind the strategies to the
registry. This step will be done automatically by Camel K, after resolving the options passed to the trait.

A sample execution of this trait, using the Kafka backend (the only one supported at the moment), would require
the following trait options:
-t resume.enabled=true -t resume.resume-path=camel-file-sets -t resume.resume-server="address-of-your-kafka:9092"


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Kubernetes, Knative, OpenShift**.
