== `[Openshift] Repeated install/uninstall and removal of CamelCatalog leads to re-creation of builder image`

Openshift's internal container image registry operates on image streams instead of directly on images. As a side effect in a non production usage it can lead to an increase of the container image storage. This is because the `uninstall` command will remove the CamelCatalog but can't remove the actual container image.

In case you don't need any change in the CamelCatalog, the solutions is to use the following flag when uninstalling if you plan to install again after:

[source,console]
----
kamel uninstall --skip-camel-catalogs
----
