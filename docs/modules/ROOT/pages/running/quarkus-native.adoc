= Run Quarkus native applications

The default Camel runtime used by Camel K is Camel Quarkus (via Camel K Runtime dependency). This is a great choice for cloud development and by default we use the JVM mode which provides already enough optimization which makes Camel applications, first class Cloud Native applications.

Quarkus (and Camel Quarkus) offers also the possibility to perform a build ahead of time (AOT) and have even further optimization, making your Camel application a native executable with very low footprint and immediate startup. This is known as Native mode and we can configure such behavior using the xref:traits:quarkus.adoc[Quarkus trait].

See the examples provided in xref:traits:quarkus.adoc#_automatic_rollout_deployment_to_native_integration[Quarkus trait] documentation page to learn how to use the feature.
