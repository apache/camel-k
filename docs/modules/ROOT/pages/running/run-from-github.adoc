= Run an Integration from GitHub

It is possible to run integrations from a GitHub repository or Gist with dedicated URL syntax:

== Integration code stored in a Github repository

.Syntax
[source]
----
kamel run github:$user/$repo/$path?branch=$branch
----

As example, running the following command


[source]
----
kamel run github:apache/camel-k/examples/languages/Sample.java
----

is equivalent to:

[source]
----
kamel run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/camel-k/main/examples/languages/Sample.java
----

but does not require to type the full GitHub RAW URL.

Declaring the branch query param is not required and defaults to `master` if not explicit set.

== Integration code stored in a Gist

.Syntax
[source]
----
kamel run https://gist.github.com/${user-id}/${gist-id}
kamel run gist:${gist-id}
----

Camel k will add any file that is part of the Gist as a source.

As example, assuming there are two files listed as part of a Gist, beans.yaml and routes.yaml, then the following command


[source]
----
kamel run gist:${gist-id}
----

is equivalent to:

[source]
----
kamel run \
    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/${user-id}/${gist-id}/raw/${...}/beans.yaml \
    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/${user-id}/${gist-id}/raw/${...}/routes.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
GitHub applies rate limiting to its APIs and as Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit, the camel-k cli honour the env var GITHUB_TOKEN and if it is found, then it is used for GitHub authentication.
