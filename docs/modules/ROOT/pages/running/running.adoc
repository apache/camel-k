= Running

After completing the xref:installation/installation.adoc[installation] you should be connected to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster
and have the "kamel" CLI correctly configured.

Ensure you're connected to the cluster by executing a simple command using the Kubernetes CLI:

```
kubectl get pod
```

Just replace `kubectl` with `oc` if you're using OpenShift. If everything is correctly configured you should get a response from the Kuerbetes API
server (you should see at least the `camel-k-operator` running).

You are now ready to create your first integration using Camel K. Just create a new Groovy file with the following content:

.hello.groovy
```groovy
from('timer:tick?period=3s')
  .setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K')
  .to('log:info')
```

You can run it on the cluster by executing:

```
kamel run hello.groovy
```

Integrations can be written in multiple languages. We provide an archive with common examples in the https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases[release page].

You can change the content of the `hello.groovy` file and execute the command again to see the changes, or use the xref:running/dev-mode.adoc[dev mode] to have even quicker turnaround times.

== Monitoring the Status

Camel K integrations follow a lifecycle composed of several steps before getting into the `Running` state.
You can check the status of all integrations by executing the following command:

```
kamel get
```
