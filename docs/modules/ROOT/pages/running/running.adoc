= Running an Integration

After completing the xref:installation/installation.adoc[installation] you should be able to run an Integration containing a Camel DSL application. The most basic configuration required is to wrap a Camel route into the Integration custom resource. Let's start with a java DSL Camel application:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: my-integration
spec:
  sources:
  - content: |
      import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

      public class Test extends RouteBuilder {
          @Override
          public void configure() throws Exception {
              from("timer:java?period=1000")
                  .setBody()
                      .simple("Hello Camel from ${routeId}")
                  .log("${body}");
          }
      }
    name: Test.java
```

Save the above as `my-integration.yaml` and apply with `kubectl apply -f my-integration.yaml`. Once the resource is stored in the cloud, the operator will take care to build, deploy and run the Camel application for you.

You can monitor the Integration with `kubectl get it -w`:

```bash
NAME             PHASE          READY   RUNTIME PROVIDER   RUNTIME VERSION   CATALOG VERSION   KIT                        REPLICAS

my-integration   Running        False   quarkus            3.8.1             3.8.1             kit-crbekb6n5tgc73cb1tkg   1
my-integration   Running        False   quarkus            3.8.1             3.8.1             kit-crbekb6n5tgc73cb1tkg   1
my-integration   Running        True    quarkus            3.8.1             3.8.1             kit-crbekb6n5tgc73cb1tkg   1
```

NOTE: we're using the shortname `it` which can be used instead longer `integration`

The first time you run the application it may takes some minute as it needs to download dependencies and build the base images that will be reused later. You may notice certain parameters like the phase and the readiness of the application. You can also see the runtime information and the number or replicas running for this application. You will learn more about IntegrationKit and other aspects in the other sections of the documentations.

You can now check the Pods which are running the application and log to see what's going on:

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

NOTE: if the above example failed, have a look at xref:troubleshooting/troubleshooting.adoc[how to troubleshoot a Camel K Integration].

== YAML DSL

In the example above we've seen how to run a Java DSL Camel application. You can use any other xref:languages/languages.adoc[Camel DSL compatible] in the same way. However, the Yaml DSL is a bit peculiar as it is a first class citizen for Camel K. Since the Integration is already a Yaml specification, then, Camel K provides a first class mechanism to embed the Yaml DSL in the Integration `.spec.flows`:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: my-it
spec:
  flows:
  - from:
      parameters:
        period: "1000"
      steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: Hello Camel from ${routeId}
      - log: ${body}
      uri: timer:yaml
```

You can see the specification is a lot neater, so, try choosing Yaml DSL whenever it's possible.

== Using Kamel CLI

Camel K works very well with any Kubernetes compatible user interface (such as CLI as `kubectl`, `oc` or any other visual tooling). However we do provide a simple CLI that helps you performing most of the Integration works in an easier fashion: it's xref:running/running-cli.adoc[`kamel` CLI].
