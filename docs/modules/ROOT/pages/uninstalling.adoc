= Uninstalling Camel K

If you really need to, it is possible to completely uninstall Camel K from OpenShift or Kubernetes with the following command:

[source]
----
kamel uninstall
----

This will uninstall from the cluster namespace all Camel K resources along with the operator.

To verify that all resources have been removed you can use the following command:

[source]
----
kubectl get all,pvc,configmap,rolebindings,clusterrolebindings,secrets,sa,roles,clusterroles,crd -l 'app=camel-k'
No resources found in default namespace.
----
