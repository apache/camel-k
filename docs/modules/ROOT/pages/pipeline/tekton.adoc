= Full fledged Pipeline

If you're running a production grade enterprise system, you likely want to use a full fledged CICD technology. The basic features provided by our xref:pipeline/pipeline.adoc[homemade Pipeline] may be definitely limited in such situation. For those production grade requirements we suggest to integrate one of the many CICD technologies around. One that we want to suggest and for which we provide an opinionated approach is https://tekton.dev/[Tekton CICD].

== Integrate with Tekton

Since Camel K version 2 we are supporting a https://hub.tekton.dev/tekton/task/kamel-run[`kamel-run` Task] included in https://hub.tekton.dev/[Tekton Hub]. You can find the instructions and some example to show you how to adopt this technology together with Camel K. The prerequisite is to have Camel K and Tekton operators up and running. The brief guide requires certain previous familiarity with Tekton technology as well.
