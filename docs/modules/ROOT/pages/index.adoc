= Apache Camel K

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures. The Camel K https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operator] is in charge to transform a user provided Integration custom resource into a Camel application running on the cloud.

Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in any Camel DSL without worrying about the building and deployment of the application on the cloud.

[[how-it-works]]
== How It Works

Just write a _helloworld.yaml_ integration file with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  flows:
  - from:
      steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: Hello Camel from ${routeId}
      - log: ${body}
      uri: timer:yaml
----

You can then execute the following command:

[source]
----
kubectl -f helloworld.yaml
----

The integration code will immediately run in the cloud. Continue reading the documentation to xref:installation/installation.adoc[install and get started with Camel K].

From Camel K version 2 onward you will be able to use any Camel K Runtime. Each runtime depends on a Camel Quarkus, Camel and Quarkus Platform version. Every Camel K has a default runtime used, but you can xref:configuration/runtime-version.adoc[pick any Camel K Runtime available] (backward and forward compatible).
