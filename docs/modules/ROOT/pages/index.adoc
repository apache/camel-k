Apache Camel K
==============

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud.

== How It Works

Just write a _helloworld.groovy_ integration file with the following content:

```groovy
from('timer:tick?period=3s')
  .setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K')
  .to('log:info')
```

You can then execute the following command:

```
kamel run helloworld.groovy
```

The integration code immediately runs in the cloud. **Nothing else** is needed.
