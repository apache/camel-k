= Camel K CLI (kamel)

The Camel K command line interface, `kamel`, is the main entry point for running integrations on a Kubernetes cluster.

Releases of the Camel K CLI are available on:

- Apache Mirrors (official): https://downloads.apache.org/camel/camel-k/
- Github Releases: https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases
- Homebrew (Mac and Linux): https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kamel

== Running on macOS

Before running the CLI on macOS, it may be necessary to give adequate permissions for it to run.

It can either be done on the "Privacy & Security" panel in the System Settings or via command-line:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/kamel
```

== Available Commands

Some of the most used commands are:

.Useful Commands

|describe
|Get detailed information on a resource
|kamel describe integration routes

|log
|Print the logs of a running integration
|kamel log routes

|delete

|===

The list above is not the full list of available commands.
You can run `kamel help` to obtain the full list.
Each command also takes the `--help` as option to output more information, e.g.:

[source,console]
----
$ kamel run --help
----

== Global Flags

While each command has a dedicated set of flags, there are global flags that are available to every command:

.Global Flags
[cols="1,2,2m"]
|===
|Flag |Description |Example

|`--kube-config PATH`
|Path to the config file to use for CLI requests
|kamel install --kube-config ~/.kube/config

|`-h` or `--help`
|Help for `kamel`, or the command
|kamel run --help

|`-n` or `--namespace NAME`
|Namespace to use for all operations
|kamel get --namespace NAME

|===

For command-specific flags, run `--help` with the command to obtain the full list, e.g.:

[source,console]
----
$ kamel <command> --help
----

== Modeline

Some command options in the CLI can be also specified as modeline in the source file, take a look at the xref:cli/modeline.adoc[Modeline] section
for more information.

[[image-registry]]
== Image Registry

The CLI can be used to xref:configuration/dependencies.adoc#local-remote-dependencies[upload] Maven dependencies and user data to the Image Registry. To do so, the CLI and the Operator have to be configured correctly.

For the Operator part, have a look at the xref:installation/registry/registry.adoc[installation] documentation.

For the CLI, in most cases, executing `docker login REGISTRY_URL` successfully will suffice.
If the Image Registry uses a custom certificate authority then it needs to be trusted, see
