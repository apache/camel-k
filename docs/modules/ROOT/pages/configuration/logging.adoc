= Configure Integration Logging

Camel K uses log4j2 as logging framework and can be configured through integration properties.
If you need to change the logging level of various loggers, you can do so by using the `logging.level` prefix:

```
logging.level.org.apache.camel=DEBUG
```

For example, you can do it when running the integration from the command line:

```
kamel run --property logging.level.org.apache.camel=DEBUG examples/routes.groovy
```
