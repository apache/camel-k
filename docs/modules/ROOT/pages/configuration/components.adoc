= Configure Integration Components

Camel components can be configured programmatically (within the integration code) or using properties with the following syntax:

[source]
----
camel.component.${scheme}.${property}=${value}
----

As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:

[source]
----
camel.component.seda.queueSize=10
----

For example, you can do it when running the integration from the command line:

[source,yaml]
.config-seda-route.yaml
----
- from:
    uri: "timer:seda"
    steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: "Hello World!"
      - to: "seda:next"
- from:
    uri: "seda:next"
    steps:
      - to: "log:info"
----

```
kamel run --property camel.component.seda.queueSize=10 config-seda-route.yaml
```
