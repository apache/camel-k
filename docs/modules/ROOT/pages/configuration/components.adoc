= Configure Integration Components

Camel components can be configured programmatically (within the integration code) or using properties with the following syntax:

```
camel.component.${scheme}.${property}=${value}
```

As example if you want to change the queue size of the seda component, you can use the following property:

```
camel.component.seda.queueSize=10
```

For example, you can do it when running the integration from the command line:

```
kamel run --property camel.component.seda.queueSize=10 examples/routes.groovy
```
