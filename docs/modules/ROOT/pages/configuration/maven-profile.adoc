= Maven Profile

You can customize the build of an integration with a https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html#profiles-in-poms[Maven profile]:

```
<profile>
  <id>my-profile</id>
  ...
</profile>
```

Once you have the file ready you can create a Configmap or a Secret in order to use it in your integration:

```
kubectl create cm my-maven-profile --from-file my-profile.xml
```

Once the Configmap/Secret is ready, then, you can use it to run your integration:

```
kamel run hello.groovy -t builder.maven-profile=configmap:my-maven-profile/my-profile.xml
```

The profile will be added to your integration's project generated pom file. What will be changed in the `mvn package` execution will depend on your profile definition.
