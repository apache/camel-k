[[build-time-props]]
= Build time properties

You may be required to provide certain *build-time properties* that are needed only during the process of `Integration` building. Since Camel K version 1.5, we introduced a `--build-property` flag that will be handful in such circumstances. The property value may be also used inside Camel K integrations using the *property placeholder* mechanism.

[[build-time-single-prop]]
== Single property

You will find this feature very useful when dealing with configuration that affects how `Quarkus` builds the `Integration`. For example, let's see how to override the default `quarkus.application.name` expected by any `Quarkus` application:

[source,groovy]
.build-property-route.groovy
----
from('timer:build-property')
    .log('The application name: {{quarkus.application.name}}')
----

In order to give a value to the `quarkus.application.name` property you can pass it using the command line with the `--build-property` flag:

----
kamel run --build-property=quarkus.application.name=my-super-application build-property-route.groovy --dev
----

You can provide more than one single `build-property` at once by just adding the flag repeatedly (ie, `--build-property=prop1=val1 --build-property=prop2=val2 ...`)

[[build-time-props-file]]
== Property File

Repeating the property flag when you have many *build time configuration* may be cumbersome. Usually you deal with property files instead. You will be able to use the _file_ syntax available for `--build-property` flag. Here, as an example you have a property files with 2 `Quarkus` properties:

[source,properties]
.quarkus.properties
----
quarkus.application.name = my-super-application
quarkus.banner.enabled = true
----

[source,groovy]
.build-property-route.groovy
----
from('timer:build-property')
    .log('The application name: {{quarkus.application.name}}')
----

The `quarkus.banner.enabled` is configured to show the banner during the `Integration` startup. Let's use `--build-property` flag in conjunction with file:

----
kamel run --build-property=file:quarkus.properties build-property-file-route.groovy --dev
----

The property file is parsed and its properties configured on the `Integration`. As soon as the application starts, you will see the log with the expected configuration.

[[build-time-runtime-conf]]
== Run time properties

If you're looking for *runtime properties configuration* you can look at the xref:configuration/runtime-properties.adoc[runtime properties] section.
