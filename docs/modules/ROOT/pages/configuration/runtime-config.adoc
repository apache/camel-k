[[runtime-config]]
= Runtime configuration

When you develop an integration with `Camel-K` there are many ways you can provide a *configuration* resource to the runtime `Integration`. The most familiar way is to handle local file, but since we are dealing with `Kubernetes` you may need also to use `Configmap` or `Secret`. The `kamel run` command is provided with a `--config` flag that help you setting any configuration resource your `Integration` need.

The *runtime configuration* are expected to be `ÙTF-8` resources as they are processed by runtime `Camel Context` and tried to be parsed as property files. These resources are materialized as files in a well known path in the `Ìntegration` `Pod`. They are also made available on the classpath in order to ease their usage directly from the `Route`. If you need to provide a non `UTF-8` (ie, a binary resource) you may look for `--resource` flag instead.

NOTE: the scope of `--config` global option had different meaning prior Camel K version 1.5. The old global `--config` has been replaced with `--kube-config` since Camel K version 1.5.

[[runtime-config-file]]
== Runtime file configuration

The most classic way to provide a configuration is probably to have a file where you have certain text data stored. In this case you can use the `--config file:/path/to/file` flag that will copy that file and made available at classpath level.

[source,txt]
.resources-data.txt
----
the file body
----

[source,groovy]
.config-file-route.groovy
----
from('timer:config-file')
    .setBody()
        .simple("resource:classpath:resources-data.txt")
    .log('resource file content is: ${body}')
----

We are referring to the file expected to be copied somewhere in the classpath, with the same name as the source file. In order to use it, we'll execute the following `--config` _file_ flag command:

----
kamel run --config file:resources-data.txt config-file-route.groovy --dev
----

You can provide more than one single `config` at once by just adding the flag repeatedly (ie, `--config file:file1.txt ---config file:file2.txt ...`).

[[runtime-config-configmap]]
== Runtime configmap configuration

In a `Kubernetes` world we're dealing with `Configmap` that are containing configuration previously stored in the platform. When you need to materialize a `Configmap` into a file configuration available at your `Integration`, you can use the `--config` _configmap_ syntax.

As an example, let's create a `Configmap` named _my-cm_ containing certain information. You can alternatively use any `Configmap` you've already stored in your cluster:

----
kubectl create configmap my-cm --from-literal=my-configmap-key="configmap content"
----

We want to use the materialized file in an integration:

[source,groovy]
.config-configmap-route.groovy
----
from('timer:configmap')
    .setBody()
        .simple("resource:classpath:my-configmap-key")
    .log('configmap content is: ${body}')
----

You can see that we're expecting to use a _my-configmap-key_ file stored somewhere in the classpath. In order to materialize the `Configmap` will be as easy as running the `--config` _configmap_ syntax:

----
kamel run --config configmap:my-cm config-configmap-route.groovy --dev
----

As soon as the `Integration` starts, the `Camel-K` operator will take care to mount a volume with the `Configmap`'s content.

NOTE: you can provide a `Configmap` which is not yet available on the cluster. The `Integration` won't start until the resource will be made available.

[[runtime-config-secret]]
== Runtime secret configuration

We can apply the very same concept seen in the previous section for the Kubernetes `Secret`s.

As an example, let's create a `Secret` named _my-sec_ containing certain information. You can alternatively use any `Secret` you've already stored in your cluster:

----
kubectl create secret generic my-sec --from-literal=my-secret-key="very top secret"
----

We want to use the materialized secret file in an integration:

[source,groovy]
.config-secret-route.groovy
----
from('timer:secret')
    .setBody()
        .simple("resource:classpath:my-secret-key")
    .log('secret content is: ${body}')
----

You can see that we're expecting to use a _my-secret-key_ file stored somewhere in the classpath. In order to materialize the `Secret` will be as easy as running the `--config` _secret_ syntax:

----
kamel run --config secret:my-sec config-secret-route.groovy --dev
----

As soon as the `Integration` starts, the `Camel-K` operator will take care to mount a volume with the `Secret`'s content.

NOTE: you can provide a `Secret` which is not yet available on the cluster. The `Integration` won't start until the resource will be made available.

[[runtime-config-keys]]
== Configmap/Secret key filtering

When you deal with `Configmap` or `Secret`, you may want to limit the quantity of information to recover from such resources. Both `Configmap` and `Secret` can hold more than one resource in the same unit. For this reason you will find a _key_ filtering feature available in the `--config` flag. In order to use it, you can add a _/key_ notation after the `Configmap` or `Secret` name (ie, `--config configmap:my-cm/my-key`).

Let's see an example with multiple `Secret` in action. The very same concept can be easily applied to `Configmap`. We start creating a `Secret` containing multiple resources:

----
kubectl create secret generic my-sec-multi --from-literal=my-secret-key="very top secret" --from-literal=my-secret-key-2="even more secret"
----

In our `Integration` we plan to use only one of the resources of the `Secret`:

[source,groovy]
.config-secret-key-route.groovy
----
from('timer:secret')
    .setBody()
        .simple("resource:classpath:my-secret-key-2")
    .log('secret content is: ${body}')
----

Let's use the _key_ filtering:

----
kamel run --config secret:my-sec-multi/my-secret-key-2 config-secret-key-route.groovy --dev
----

You may check in the `Integration` `Pod` that only the _my-secret-key-2_ file has been mounted.

== Runtime resources

If you're looking for *runtime resources* (ie, binary resources) you can look at the xref:configuration/runtime-resources.adoc[runtime resources] section.
