= Installing Camel K on OpenShift

Installation of Camel K on OpenShift requires that you execute first some specific actions as cluster-admin.

OpenShift does not always provide full cluster-admin rights to all users, so you may need to contact an administrator to install the
Kubernetes custom resources and roles needed by Camel K.

You need to get the *kamel* CLI (_camel-k-client_) tool the from https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases[release page]
and put it on your system path (e.g. on `/usr/bin/kamel` on Linux).

To install the custom resource definitions and related roles, just execute (with **cluster-admin role**):

```
kamel install --cluster-setup
```

Once you've done this **only once per the whole cluster**, you can **login as a standard user** and
continue with the xref:installation/installation.adoc#procedure[standard Camel K installation procedure].
