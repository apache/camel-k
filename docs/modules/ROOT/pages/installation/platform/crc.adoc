Follow the instructions in the https://code-ready.github.io/crc/[getting started guide] for the installation.

After https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#setting-up-codeready-containers_gsg[setting up] and https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#starting-the-virtual-machine_gsg[starting] the cluster you will need to login with the `kubeadmin` user as shown in the startup logs (or setting up a user with sufficient permissions).
