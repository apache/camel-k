= Configuring a Github Packages Registry

You can use a Github Packages registry to host your container images.

Login to Github, then navigate to `Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens`. Create a new token with the following permissions:

* `repo` (all)
* `write:packages`
* `read:packages`
* `delete:packages`

Take note of the personal access token, you'll use it during installation. You also need to **choose a github repository** for hosting your images.

Finally you can xref:installation/registry/registry-secret.adoc[configure the secret] with the following parameters:

* registry: docker.pkg.github.com
* organization: github-user/repository
* registry-auth-username: github-user-id
* registry-auth-password: github-token
