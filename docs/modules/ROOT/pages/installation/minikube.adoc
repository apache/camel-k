= Installing Camel K on Minikube

You can run Camel K integrations on plain Kubernetes using the Minikube cluster creation tool.
Follow the instructions in the https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[official doc] for the installation.

Start a new instance of Minikube using the command:

```
minikube start
```

After the startup process is completed, you need to **enable the `registry` addon**:

```
minikube addons enable registry
```

You can now proceed with the xref:installation/index.adoc#procedure[standard Camel K installation procedure].
