= Run a Maven Proxy

Production or corporate environments generally relies on a corporate Maven repository manager that can be used as a proxy for your Camel K operator. This is a https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html[Maven best practice] we want to foster as it improves efficiency while performing Camel K builds.

If your environments has not yet any, here we provide some simple example that can be used as a reference to run your own Maven proxy beside Camel K.

== Nexus Maven repository manager

The following configuration is a very simple one from where you can start your own self managed Maven repository manager. It is based on https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository[Nexus] and once it's up and running, it can work togheter with Camel K as explained in /camel-k/next/installation/advanced/maven.html#maven-proxy[Maven proxy configuration].

NOTE: this configuration is NOT production ready. It is ephemeral and uses plain http protocol. It requires some important tuning in order to be used in a production environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nexus

  selector:
    app: nexus
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8081

          ports:
            - containerPort: 8081
              name: 8081-tcp
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /service/rest/v1/status
              port: 8081
            initialDelaySeconds: 90
            periodSeconds: 3
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /service/rest/v1/status
              port: 8081
            initialDelaySeconds: 90
            periodSeconds: 3
          volumeMounts:
            - name: nexus-data
              mountPath: /nexus-data
      volumes:
        - name: nexus-data
          emptyDir: {}
```

Once you have created a file with this content (ie, `nexus.yaml`), then, you can apply to your cluster via `kubectl apply -f nexus.yaml`. Et voil√°, after a few seconds, you will be able to use http://nexus/ as a Maven proxy repository.
