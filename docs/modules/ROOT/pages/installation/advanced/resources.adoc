[[scheduling-infra-pod]]
= Infrastructure Pods and Resource Management

During the installation procedure you will be able to provide information on how to best "operationalize" your infrastructure. Through the configuration of `--node-selector`, `--toleration` and `--operator-resources` you will be able to drive the operator `Pods` scheduling and to be able to assign resources.

The usage of these advanced properties assumes you're familiar with the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/[Kubernetes Scheduling] concepts and configurations.

NOTE: The aforementioned flags setting will work both with `OLM` installation and regular installation.

== Scheduling

=== Node Selectors
The most basic operation we provide is to let you assign Camel K operator `Pods` to a specific cluster `Node`. The functionality is based on https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[`NodeSelector` Kubernetes feature]. As an example, you can schedule Camel K infra `Pods` to a specific `Node` of your cluster. See how to configure according the installation methodology selected.

=== Tolerations
The `--toleration` option will let you tolerate a Camel K infra `Pod` to support any matching `Taint` according the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[`Taint` and `Toleration` Kubernetes feature]. As an example, let's suppose we have a node tainted as "dedicated=camel-k:NoSchedule". In order to allow the infra `Pods` to be scheduled on that `Node` we can provide the following option during installation procedure. See how to configure according the installation methodology selected.

[[scheduling-infra-pod-resources]]
== Resources

While installing the Camel K operator, you can also specify the resources requests and limits to assign to the operator `Pod` with `--operator-resources` option. The option will expect the configuration as required by https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[Kubernetes Resource Management]. See how to configure according the installation methodology selected.

NOTE: if you specify a limit, but does not specify a request, Kubernetes automatically assigns a request that matches the limit.

=== Default Operator Pod configuration

The main Camel K Operator Pod contributor resources consumption is likely to be the number of parallel builds that are performed in the operator `Pod`. So the resource requirements should be defined accordingly. The following requirements are sensible defaults that should work in most cases:

```
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "8Gi"
    cpu: "2"
```

Note that if you plan to perform **native builds**, then the memory requirements may be increased significantly. Also, the CPU requirements are rather "soft", in the sense that it won't break the operator, but it'll perform slower in general.

=== Default Integration Pod configuration

The resource set on the container here is highly dependant on what your application is doing. You can control this behavior by setting opportunely the resources on the Integration via container trait.

Be aware that the default are actually the following:

```
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "125m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
```
