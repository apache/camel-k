[[installation]]
= Installation

Camel K allows us to run Camel integrations directly on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. To use it, you need to be connected to a cloud environment or to a local cluster created for development purposes (ie, Minikube or Kind).

[[cli]]
== Installation via Kamel CLI

To start using Camel K you need the **"kamel"** CLI tool, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations. Look into the https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases[release page] for the latest version of the *camel-k-client* tool for your specific platform.

Download and deflate the archive. It contains a small binary file named `kamel` that you should put into your system path. For example, if you're using Linux, you can put `kamel` in `/usr/bin`.

Once you have put the `kamel` CLI in the path, log into your cluster using the standard `oc` (OpenShift) or `kubectl` (Kubernetes) client tool and execute the following command to install Camel K:

[source]
----
$ kamel install --olm=false
----

NOTE: if you're not using Minikube or Openshift, make sure to have a xref:installation/registry/registry.adoc#configuring-registry-install-time[container registry] available and use also `--registry` parameter.

This will configure the cluster with the Camel K custom resource definitions and install the operator on the current namespace with the default settings.

IMPORTANT: Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are cluster-wide objects and you need admin rights to install them. Fortunately, this operation can be done *once per cluster*. So, if the `kamel install` operation fails, you'll be asked to repeat it when logged as admin.
For CRC, this means executing `oc login -u system:admin` then `kamel install --cluster-setup` only for the first-time installation.

[[kustomize]]
== Installation via Kustomize

Camel K can be installed using https://kustomize.io[Kustomize], providing an interface for configuring more advanced features.

**First you need to get the kustomize files**

```
# Clone the project repository
$ https://github.com/apache/camel-k.git
$ cd camel-k
# You can use any release branch or skip this step to use it the last code on `main`
$ git checkout release-a.b.x
$ cd install
```

**Next you need to apply configuration at cluster level**

```
$ kubectl kustomize --load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone setup-cluster/ | kubectl create -f -
```

**Then the roles and privileges needs to be added**

```
$ kubectl apply -k setup
$ kubectl apply -k config/rbac/namespaced
# For openshift
$ kubectl apply -k config/rbac/openshift
$ kubectl apply -k config/rbac/openshift/namespaced
```

Should you want your operator operator to watch all namespaces (global operator), you will replace `config/rbac/namespaced` by `config/rbac/descoped` and `config/rbac/openshift/namespaced` by `config/rbac/openshift/descoped`.

**Finally the operator can be deployed**

```
$ kubectl apply -k operator
$ kubectl apply -k platform
```

By default the operator is configured to get the registry information from a Configmap expected the namespace `kube-public` like this example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: local-registry-hosting
  namespace: kube-public
data:
  localRegistryHosting.v1: |
    hostFromContainerRuntime: "registry:5000"
```

NOTE: you probably want to edit the configuration. Please, do any change right after cloning the repository. Be careful to avoid making any modification in the `install/config` folder.

More information on the xref:installation/advanced/kustomize.adoc[Kustomize Camel K installation procedure] page.

[[olm]]
== Installation via Operator Hub

Camel K is also available in Operator Hub. You will need to OLM framework to be properly installed in your cluster. More instructions on the https://operatorhub.io/operator/camel-k[Camel K Operator Hub] page.

```
$ kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/camel-k.yaml
```

You can edit the `Subscription` custom resource, setting the channel you want to use. From Camel K version 2 onward, we're going to provide an installation channel for each major version we're releasing (ie, `stable-v2`). This will simplify the upgrade process if you choose to perform an automatic upgrade.

NOTE: Some Kubernetes clusters such as Openshift (or CRC) may let you to perform the same operation from a GUI as well. Refer to the cluster instruction to learn how to perform such action.


[[helm]]
== Installation via Helm Hub

Camel K is also available in Helm Hub:

```
$ helm repo add camel-k https://apache.github.io/camel-k/charts/
$ helm install my-camel-k camel-k/camel-k
```

More instructions on the https://hub.helm.sh/charts/camel-k/camel-k[Camel K Helm] page.

[[test]]
== Test your installation

Once you've completed any of the above installation procedure, you'll be ready to xref:running/running.adoc[run some integrations].

[[special-requirements]]
== Special clusters requirements

Camel K installation is usually straightforward, but for certain cluster types you need to apply specific configuration settings before installing it. You need customized instructions for the following cluster types:

- xref:installation/platform/digitalocean.adoc[DigitalOcean]
- xref:installation/platform/docker-desktop.adoc[Docker Desktop]
- xref:installation/platform/gke.adoc[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]
- xref:installation/platform/iks.adoc[IBM Kubernetes Services (IKS)]
- xref:installation/platform/k3s.adoc[K3s]
- xref:installation/platform/kind.adoc[Kind]
- xref:installation/platform/minikube.adoc[Minikube]
- xref:installation/platform/openshift.adoc[OpenShift]
- xref:installation/platform/crc.adoc[Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC)]

NOTE: Minishift is no longer supported since Camel K 1.5.0. You can use xref:installation/platform/crc.adoc[CRC] for a local OpenShift cluster.

[[fine-tuning]]
== Fine Tuning

Camel K installation can be configured with certain special settings available for experienced users. You can manage resources such as limiting memory and CPU, provide a policy for `Pod` scheduling and `Toleration`. Please have a look at xref:installation/advanced/advanced.adoc[Camel K fine tuning] to learn more about advanced configuration.
