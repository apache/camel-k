= Installing Camel K on Minishift

You can run Camel K integrations on OpenShift using the Minishift cluster creation tool.
Follow the instructions in the https://github.com/minishift/minishift#getting-started[getting started guide] for the installation.

After installing the `minishift` binary, you need to enable the `admin-user` addon:

```
minishift addons enable admin-user
```

NOTE: the admin user addon should be enabled before starting the cluster for the first time

Then you can start the cluster with:

```
minishift start
```

You can now proceed with the xref:installation.adoc#procedure[standard Camel K installation procedure].
