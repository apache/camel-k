= Java API

If you want to integrate the Kubernetes API in your software, we support a https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client[kubernetes-client] typed API to access Camel K/Kamelets resources from Java programming language. This autogenerated project is released with any release of Camel K, so, the version you're willing to use is aligned with the one of the operator released.

Importing the dependency in Maven projects looks like:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.k</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-k-crds</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

At this stage you can easily use them such in the following example:

[source,java]
----
var client = new KubernetesClientBuilder().build();
var camelCatalogClient = client.resources(CamelCatalog.class);
camelCatalogClient.list() ...
----
