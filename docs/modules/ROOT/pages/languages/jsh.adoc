= Writing Integrations in Java

[WARNING]
====
The JShell DSL is experimental.
====

Using Java and JShell to write an integration to be deployed using Camel K is no different from defining your routing rules in Camel with the only difference that you do not need to implement or extend a RouteBuilder but you can access the current builder thx to the built-in `builder` variable.

[source,java]
.example.jsh
----
builder.from("timer:tick")
    .setBody()
        .constant("Hello Camel K!")
    .to("log:info");-
----

You can run it with the standard command:

```
kamel run example.jsh
```
