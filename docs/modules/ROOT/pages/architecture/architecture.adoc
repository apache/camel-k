== Concepts

The main *Camel K* platform concepts are:

1. The xref:architecture/operator.adoc[Operator] which is the intelligence that coordinates all the moving parts;
2. The xref:architecture/runtime.adoc[Runtime] which provides the functionality to run the integration;
3. The xref:architecture/traits.adoc[Traits] through which the behavior of the operator and the runtime can be customized.

For information on how *Camel K* is able to provide *Sources* e.g. for the Knative platform:

- The xref:architecture/sources.adoc[Sources] page describes how sources are internally materialized.
