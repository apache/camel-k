The *Camel K* core platform is based on three concepts:

1. The xref:architecture/operator.adoc[Operator] which is the intelligence that coordinates all the moving parts.
2. The xref:architecture/runtime.adoc[Runtime] which provides the functionality to run the integration.
3. The xref:architecture/traits.adoc[Traits] through which the behavior of the operator and the runtime can be customized.

For information on how *Camel K* is able to provide *Sources* e.g. for the Knative platform:

- The xref:architecture/sources.adoc[Sources] page describes how sources are internally materialized.
