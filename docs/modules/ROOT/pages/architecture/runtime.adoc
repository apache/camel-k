Camel runtime application is in charge to bridge the output produced by the operator during a `Build` to the Camel runtime. It will finally execute an application containing the `Route` as defined by `Camel K` user. It will take care of converting all the different configuration and tuning into something meaningful to `Apache Camel` framework. The default runtime used is xref:camel-quarkus::index.adoc[Camel Quarkus].

NOTE: versions of Camel K prior to 2.3 used to have a runtime called Camel K Runtime which was based on Camel Quarkus.
