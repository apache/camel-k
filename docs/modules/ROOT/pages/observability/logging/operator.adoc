= Camel K Operator Logging

The operator provides https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/[structured logging], so that the logs are more easily parseable.

This includes the output of components managed by the operator, such as the Maven build, and the Integration container image build.

For example, the Maven build logs display like this:

[source,json]
----
{"level":"info","ts":1620393185.321101,"logger":"camel-k.maven.build","msg":"Downloading from repository-000: http://my.repository.com:8081/artifactory/fuse-brno/org/jboss/shrinkwrap/resolver/shrinkwrap-resolver-bom/2.2.4/shrinkwrap-resolver-bom-2.2.4.pom"}
----

This may differ when running the operator locally, for development purposes, in which case the local Maven installation that is used may provide a different output.
