= Camel K Operator Logging

The Camel K Operator logging is mostly managed by the Kubernetes infrastructure, with some specific aspects managed by
Camel K itself. The operator uses https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/[structured logs]
so that the logs are more easily parseable.

This includes the output of components managed by the operator, such as the maven build, and the integration container build.
For example, the maven build logs should be displayed like this:


```
{"level":"info","ts":1620393185.321101,"logger":"camel-k.maven.build","msg":"Downloading from repository-000: http://my.repository.com:8081/artifactory/fuse-brno/org/jboss/shrinkwrap/resolver/shrinkwrap-resolver-bom/2.2.4/shrinkwrap-resolver-bom-2.2.4.pom"}
```

There are some exceptions to this, though, and they are mostly related to running the operator for development purposes.
