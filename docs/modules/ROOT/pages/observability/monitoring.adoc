= Camel K Monitoring

The Camel K monitoring architecture relies on https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] and the eponymous operator.

The https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator] serves to make running Prometheus on top of Kubernetes as easy as possible, while preserving Kubernetes-native configuration options.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To take fully advantage of the Camel K monitoring capabilities, it is recommended to have a Prometheus Operator instance, that can be configured to integrate Camel K integrations.

[[kubernetes]]
=== Kubernetes

You can deploy the Prometheus operator by running:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/v0.38.0/bundle.yaml
----

WARNING: Beware this installs the operator in the `default` namespace. You must download the file locally and replace the `namespace` fields to deploy the resources into another namespace.

Then, you can create a `Prometheus` resource, that the operator will use as configuration to deploy a managed Prometheus instance:

[source,sh]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: camel.apache.org/integration
        operator: Exists
EOF
----

By default, the Prometheus instance discovers applications to be monitored in the same namespace.
You can use the `serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector` field from the `Prometheus` resource to enable cross-namespace monitoring.
You may also need to specify a ServiceAccount with the `serviceAccountName` field, that's bound to a Role with the necessary permissions.

[[openshift]]
=== OpenShift

Starting OpenShift 4.3, the Prometheus Operator, that's already deployed as part of the monitoring stack, can be used to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html[monitor application services].
This needs to be enabled by following these instructions:

. Check whether the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object exists in the `openshift-monitoring` project:

  $ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config

. If it does not exist, create it:

  $ oc -n openshift-monitoring create configmap cluster-monitoring-config

. Start editing the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap:

  $ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config

. Set the `techPreviewUserWorkload` setting to `true` under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    techPreviewUserWorkload:
      enabled: true
----

On OpenShift versions prior to 4.3, or if you do not want to change your cluster monitoring stack configuration, you can refer to the <<Kubernetes>> section in order to deploy a separate Prometheus Operator instance.

[[instrumentation]]
== Instrumentation

The xref:traits:prometheus.adoc[Prometheus trait] automates the configuration of integration pods to expose a _metrics_ endpoint, that can be discovered and scrapped by a Prometheus server.

The Prometheus trait can be enabled when running an integration, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.enabled=true ...
----

Alternatively, the Prometheus trait can be enabled globally once, by updating the integration platform, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl patch ip camel-k --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"traits":{"prometheus":{"configuration":{"enabled":"true"}}}}}'
----

The underlying instrumentation mechanism depends on the configured integration runtime.
As a result, the set of registered metrics, as well as the naming convention they follow, also depends on it.

=== Main

When the default, a.k.a. _main_, runtime is configured for the integration, the https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[JMX exporter] is responsible for collecting and exposing metrics from JMX mBeans.

A custom configuration for the JMX exporter can be used by setting the `prometheus.configmap` parameter from the Prometheus trait with the name of a ConfigMap containing a `prometheus-jmx-exporter.yaml` key, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.enabled=true -t prometheus.configmap=<jmx_exporter_config>...
----

Otherwise, the Prometheus trait uses a default configuration.

=== Quarkus

When the Quarkus runtime is configured for the integration, the https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/extensions/microprofile-metrics.html[Camel Quarkus MicroProfile Metrics extension] is responsible for collecting and exposing metrics in the https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics[OpenMetrics] text format.

The MicroProfile Metrics extension registers and exposes the following metrics out-of-the-box:

* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/required-metrics.adoc#required-metrics[JVM and operating system related metrics]

* https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/extensions/microprofile-metrics.html#_camel_route_metrics[Camel specific metrics]

It is possible to extend this set of metrics by using either, or both:

* The https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/microprofile-metrics-component.html[MicroProfile Metrics component]

* The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/app-programming-model.adoc#annotations[MicroProfile Metrics annotations], in external dependencies

== Discovery

The Prometheus trait automatically configures the resources necessary for the Prometheus Operator to reconcile, so that the managed Prometheus instance can scrape the integration _metrics_ endpoint.

By default, the Prometheus trait creates a `ServiceMonitor` resource, with the `camel.apache.org/integration` label, which must match the `serviceMonitorSelector` field from the `Prometheus` resource.
Additional labels can be specified with the `service-monitor-labels` parameter from the Prometheus trait, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.service-monitor-labels="label_to_be_match_by=prometheus_selector" ...
----

The creation of the `ServiceMonitor` resource can be disabled using the `service-monitor` parameter, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.service-monitor=false ...
----

More information can be found in the xref:traits:prometheus.adoc[Prometheus trait] documentation.

The Prometheus Operator https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.38.0/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#related-resources[getting started] guide documents the discovery mechanism, as well as the relationship between the operator resources.

In case your integration metrics are not discovered, you may want to rely on https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.38.0/Documentation/troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-servicemonitor-changes[Troubleshooting `ServiceMonitor` changes].

== Alerting

The Prometheus Operator declares the `AlertManager` resource that can be used to configure _Alertmanager_ instances, along with `Prometheus` instances.

Assuming an `AlertManager` resource already exists in your cluster, you can register a `PrometheusRule` resource that is used by Prometheus to trigger alerts, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: example
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-rules
spec:
  groups:
  - name: camel-k.rules
    rules:
    - alert: CamelKAlert
      expr: application_camel_context_exchanges_failed_total > 0
EOF
----

More information can be found in the Prometheus Operator https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.38.0/Documentation/user-guides/alerting.md[Alerting] user guide. You can also find more details in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/monitoring/monitoring-your-own-services.html#creating-alerting-rules_monitoring-your-own-services[Creating alerting rules] from the OpenShift documentation.

== Autoscaling

Integration metrics can be exported for horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA), using the https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter[custom metrics Prometheus adapter].
If you have an OpenShift cluster, you can follow https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/monitoring/exposing-custom-application-metrics-for-autoscaling.html[Exposing custom application metrics for autoscaling] to set it up.

Assuming you have the Prometheus adapter up and running, you can create a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` resource, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: camel-k-autoscaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
    kind: Integration
    name: example
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: application_camel_context_exchanges_inflight_count
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 1k
EOF
----

More information can be found in https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler] from the Kubernetes documentation.
