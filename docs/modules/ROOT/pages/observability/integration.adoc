NOTE: The Camel K monitoring architecture relies on https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] and the eponymous operator. Make sure you've checked the xref:observability/monitoring.adoc#prerequisites[Camel K monitoring prerequisites].

[[instrumentation]]
== Instrumentation

The xref:traits:prometheus.adoc[Prometheus trait] automates the configuration of integration pods to expose a _metrics_ endpoint, that can be discovered and scraped by a Prometheus server.

The Prometheus trait can be enabled when running an integration, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.enabled=true ...
----

Alternatively, the Prometheus trait can be enabled globally once, by updating the integration platform, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl patch ip camel-k --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"traits":{"prometheus":{"configuration":{"enabled":true}}}}}'
----

Or by directly editing the `IntegrationPlatform` resource, e.g.:
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: IntegrationPlatform
metadata:
  name: camel-k
spec:
  traits:
    prometheus:
      configuration:
        enabled: true # <1>
----
<1> Actives the Prometheus trait at the platform level

The underlying instrumentation mechanism depends on the configured integration runtime.
As a result, the set of registered metrics, as well as the naming convention they follow, also depends on it.

=== Main

When the default, a.k.a. _main_, runtime is configured for the integration, the https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[JMX exporter] is responsible for collecting and exposing metrics from JMX mBeans.

A custom configuration for the JMX exporter can be used by setting the `prometheus.configmap` parameter from the Prometheus trait with the name of a ConfigMap containing a `prometheus-jmx-exporter.yaml` key, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.enabled=true -t prometheus.configmap=<jmx_exporter_config>...
----

Otherwise, the Prometheus trait uses a default configuration.

=== Quarkus

When the Quarkus runtime is configured for the integration, the xref:latest@camel-quarkus::reference/extensions/microprofile-metrics.adoc[Camel Quarkus MicroProfile Metrics extension] is responsible for collecting and exposing metrics in the https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics[OpenMetrics] text format.

The MicroProfile Metrics extension registers and exposes the following metrics out-of-the-box:

* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/required-metrics.adoc#required-metrics[JVM and operating system related metrics]

* xref:latest@camel-quarkus::reference/extensions/microprofile-metrics.adoc#_camel_route_metrics[Camel specific metrics]

It is possible to extend this set of metrics by using either, or both:

* The xref:latest@components::microprofile-metrics-component.adoc[MicroProfile Metrics component]

* The https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/app-programming-model.adoc#annotations[MicroProfile Metrics annotations], in external dependencies

== Discovery

The Prometheus trait automatically configures the resources necessary for the Prometheus Operator to reconcile, so that the managed Prometheus instance can scrape the integration _metrics_ endpoint.

By default, the Prometheus trait creates a `ServiceMonitor` resource, with the `camel.apache.org/integration` label, which must match the `serviceMonitorSelector` field from the `Prometheus` resource.
Additional labels can be specified with the `service-monitor-labels` parameter from the Prometheus trait, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.service-monitor-labels="label_to_be_match_by=prometheus_selector" ...
----

The creation of the `ServiceMonitor` resource can be disabled using the `service-monitor` parameter, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ kamel run -t prometheus.service-monitor=false ...
----

More information can be found in the xref:traits:prometheus.adoc[Prometheus trait] documentation.

The Prometheus Operator https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.38.0/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#related-resources[getting started] guide documents the discovery mechanism, as well as the relationship between the operator resources.

In case your integration metrics are not discovered, you may want to rely on https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/v0.38.0/Documentation/troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-servicemonitor-changes[Troubleshooting `ServiceMonitor` changes].

== Alerting

The Prometheus Operator declares the `AlertManager` resource that can be used to configure _Alertmanager_ instances, along with `Prometheus` instances.

Assuming an `AlertManager` resource already exists in your cluster, you can register a `PrometheusRule` resource that is used by Prometheus to trigger alerts, e.g.:

[source,sh]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: example
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-rules
spec:
  groups:
  - name: camel-k.rules
    rules:
    - alert: CamelKAlert
      expr: application_camel_context_exchanges_failed_total > 0
EOF
----
