= Camel Dashboard

https://camel-tooling.github.io/camel-dashboard/[Camel Dashboard] is a Kubernetes operator that you can use to monitor your fleet of Camel applications deployed in the cloud. Whether you use Camel K to deploy or not, the Dashboard is a great tool that you can use to monitor your Camel fleet.

NOTE: the project is in developer preview mode.

The Camel Dashboard was originally born as a spin off from Camel K Synthetic Integrations features and matured into a brand new operator whose goal is to provide a meaningful set of information about typical KPIs of your fleet of Camel workloads running on the cloud.

From Camel K version 2.10.0 onward, the applications deployed by the operator will be automatically instructed with the labels required by the Dashboard to discover and monitor. This is controlled via a Kubernetes label injected to the Deployments (or CronJob or KnativeService) configured on the operator side with the environment variable `CAMEL_DASHBOARD_APP_LABEL` (set by default to `camel.apache.org/app`).

On the Camel Dashboard side, any application containing the label will be watched and monitored providing a set of useful Camel metrics (for example, health, number of exchanges succeeded, failed, ...).

You will need to include the `camel-observability-services` component into your application in order to get the full power of this monitoring tool. As an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: sample-it
spec:
  dependencies:
    - mvn:org.apache.camel.quarkus:camel-quarkus-observability-services
  flows:
    - route:
        id: send-5-messages
        from:
          uri: "timer:tick?repeatCount=5"
          steps:
            - setBody:
                simple: "Hello!"
            - to: "log:myLogger"
  traits:
    # We need a provide any version supporting camel-observability-services
    camel:
      runtimeProvider: plain-quarkus
      runtimeVersion: 3.30.8
```

The information will be stored in a Custom Resource provided by the Camel Dashboard installation procedure: `CamelApp`. Here a basic example:

```bash
$ kubectl get camelapp -w

NAME           IMAGE                                              PHASE     REPLICAS   HEALTHY   MONITORED   INFO                        EXCHANGE SLI   LAST EXCHANGE

```

More in detail, the specific info are stored in the custom resource status:

NOTE: Camel K won't require the availability of Camel Dashboard to work, neither Camel Dashboard would require Camel K, they are independent projects which can cooperate to provide a Build and Monitoring tool.
