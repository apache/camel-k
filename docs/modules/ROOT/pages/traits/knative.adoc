= Knative Trait

// Start of autogenerated code - DO NOT EDIT! (description)
The Knative trait automatically discovers addresses of Knative resources and inject them into the
running integration.

The full Knative configuration is injected in the CAMEL_KNATIVE_CONFIGURATION in JSON format.
The Camel Knative component will then use the full configuration to configure the routes.

The trait is enabled by default when the Knative profile is active.


This trait is available in the following profiles: **Knative**.

|===
|Property | Type | Description

| knative.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

| knative.configuration
| string
| Can be used to inject a Knative complete configuration in JSON format.

| knative.channel-sources
| string
| Comma-separated list of channels used as source of integration routes.
Can contain simple channel names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.channel-sinks
| string
| Comma-separated list of channels used as destination of integration routes.
Can contain simple channel names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.endpoint-sources
| string
| Comma-separated list of channels used as source of integration routes.

| knative.endpoint-sinks
| string
| Comma-separated list of endpoints used as destination of integration routes.
Can contain simple endpoint names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.event-sources
| string
| Comma-separated list of event types that the integration will be subscribed to.
