// The Knative Service trait allows configuring options when running the Integration as a Knative service, instead of
// a standard Kubernetes Deployment.
//
// Running an Integration as a Knative Service enables auto-scaling (and scaling-to-zero), but those features
// are only relevant when the Camel route(s) use(s) an HTTP endpoint consumer.
