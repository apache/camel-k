    CronJob instead of a standard deployment, in order to save resources when the

    for using a Kubernetes CronJob are the following: - `timer`: when periods can
    be written as cron expressions. E.g. `timer:tick?period=60000`. - `cron`, `quartz`:
    when the cron expression does not contain seconds (or the "seconds" part is set
    to 0). E.g. `cron:tab?schedule=0/2${plus}*{plus}*{plus}*{plus}?` or `quartz:trigger?cron=0{plus}0/2{plus}*{plus}*{plus}*{plus}?`.'

  description: The platform trait is a base trait that is used to assign an integration
    platform to an integration. In case the platform is missing, the trait is allowed
    to create a default platform. This feature is especially useful in contexts where
    there's no need to provide a custom configuration for the platform (e.g. on OpenShift
    the default settings work, since there's an embedded container image registry).

    container registry on the `IntegrationPlatform`, the same secret is used to pull
    images. It's enabled by default whenever you configure authentication for an external
    container registry, so it assumes that external registries are private. If your
    registry does not need authentication for pulling images, you can disable this
    trait.
